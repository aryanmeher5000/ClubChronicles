## 🧗 Challenges Faced

This was my **first major project**, and I encountered several challenges along the way:

- No prior experience with **React**, **React Router**, or **TypeScript**
- Learning **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** from scratch
- Building RESTful APIs with **Node.js** and **Express**
- Figuring out how and where to store media files
- Navigating UI/UX design without any knowledge of UI libraries

---

## 📚 What I Learned

Despite the hurdles, I gained a ton of valuable knowledge:

- Creating **reusable React components**
- Managing complex state using **Zustand** and **React Query**
- Implementing **middlewares**, validation, and modular backend routes
- Using **Cloudinary** to handle file and media uploads
- Writing scalable, clean, and maintainable **TypeScript** code
